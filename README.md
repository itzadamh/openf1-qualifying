# openf1-qualifying
A small project I am working on using the [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/).

Currently it is based off of the F1 Qualifying results for the latest race (Singapore 2025).

# Requirements
Python, with the module "requests" installed.

```pip install requests```

# Planned/Potential Features
- [x] Formatting changes - changing the lap time to mm:ss:ss.
- [ ] Potential statistics including gap timing.
- [x] Allowing user input, aka "Silverstone", "2024".
