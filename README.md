# openf1-qualifying
A small project I am working on using the [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/).

Originally based off of the Singapore 2025 qualifying results, it now has user input functionality. For the race you want to see qualifying results for, you enter the name of the country and the year, and the program will display the results.

# Requirements
Python, with the module "requests" installed.

```pip install requests```

# Planned/Potential Features
- [x] Formatting changes - changing the lap time to mm:ss:ss.
- [ ] Potential statistics including gap timing.
- [x] Allowing user input, aka "Silverstone", "2024".
