# openf1-qualifying
A small project I am working on using the OpenF1 API.

Currently it is based off of the F1 Qualifying results for the latest race (Singapore 2025).

# Planned/Potential Features
- Replacing meeting keys and session keys with their respective values. (name of the race/name of session)
- Formatting changes - changing the lap time to mm:ss:ss.
- Potential statistics including gap timing.
- Allowing user input, aka "Silverstone", "2024", "Qualifying".
